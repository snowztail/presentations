abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. The use of multisine signals to improve the efficiency of wireless power transfer (WPT) for low average received power was proposed recently. Several measurement-based studies illustrated the gain that can be achieved for different circuit or waveform instances, focusing on the impact of a time-varying amplitude on the rectifying efficiency. This paper first establishes a model enabling a thorough analysis of the multisine-based WPT system focusing on the bandwidth of the signal and the rectifier. This model enables a codesign of signal and rectifier for optimal WPT. The proposed model provides insight into the output voltage and power, as a function of the input waveform for different circuit models. By including the input matching and the clamper, our model is generic and can include a wide range of rectifiers with different voltage multiplication approaches. The key insight gained from our analysis is that there is a tradeoff between the frequency spacing of the tones of the multisine signal and the cut-off frequency of the low-pass RC filter, as a main property of the rectifier circuit. Our model predicts the measured power conversion efficiency and voltage with an error below 0.1 and 0.2 V, respectively.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the optimal design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in downlink multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. For information transmission, we consider two types of multiple access schemes, namely, time division multiple access (TDMA) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). At the receiver side, due to the practical limitation that circuits for harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet able to decode the carried information directly, each user applies either time switching (TS) or power splitting (PS) to coordinate the energy harvesting (EH) and information decoding (ID) processes. For the TDMA-based information transmission, we employ TS at the receivers; for the OFDMA-based information transmission, we employ PS at the receivers. Under the above two scenarios, we address the problem of maximizing the weighted sum-rate over all users by varying the time/frequency power allocation and either TS or PS ratio, subject to a minimum harvested energy constraint on each user as well as a peak and/or total transmission power constraint. For the TS scheme, by an appropriate variable transformation the problem is reformulated as a convex problem, for which the optimal power allocation and TS ratio are obtained by the Lagrange duality method. For the PS scheme, we propose an iterative algorithm to optimize the power allocation, subcarrier (SC) allocation and the PS ratio for each user. The performances of the two schemes are compared numerically as well as analytically for the special case of single-user setup. It is revealed that the peak power constraint imposed on each OFDM SC as well as the number of users in the system play a key role in the rate-energy performance comparison by the two proposed schemes.},

@article{Kim2018,
abstract = {When simultaneous wireless information and power transfer is carried out, a fundamental tradeoff between achievable rate and harvested energy exists because the received power is used for two different purposes. The tradeoff is well characterized by the rate-energy region, and several techniques have been proposed to improve the achievable rate-energy region. However, the existing techniques still have a considerable loss in either energy or rate and thus the known achievable rate-energy regions are far from the ideal one. Deriving tight upper and lower bounds on the rate-energy region of our proposed scheme, we prove that the rate-energy region can be expanded almost to the ideal upper bound. Contrary to the existing techniques, in the proposed scheme, the information decoding circuit not only extracts amplitude and phase information but also combines the extracted information with the amplitude information obtained from the rectified signal. Consequently, the required energy for decoding can be minimized, and thus the proposed scheme achieves a near-optimal rate-energy region, which implies that the fundamental tradeoff in the achievable rate-energy region is nearly eliminated. To practically account for the theoretically achievable rate-energy region, we also present practical examples with an {\$}M{\$}-ary multi-level circular QAM with Gaussian maximum likelihood detection.},

Over the last few years, GP has been used to solve a variety of problems in the analysis and design of communication systems in several layers in the commu- nication network architecture, including information theory problems, signal processing algorithms, basic queuing system optimization, many network resource allocation problems such as power control and conges- tion control, and cross-layer design. We also start to understand why, in addition to how, GP can be applied to a surprisingly wide range of problems in communication systems. These applications have in turn spurred new research activities on GP, especially generalizations of GP formulations and development of distributed algorithms to solve GP in a network. This text provides both an in-depth tutorial on the theory, algorithms, and modeling methods of GP, and a comprehensive survey on the applications of GP to the study of communication systems.},

abstract = {Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is anticipated to have abundant applications in future machine or sensor based wireless networks by providing wireless data and energy access at the same time. In this paper, we study a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast SWIPT system, where a multi-antenna access point (AP) sends information and energy simultaneously via spatial multiplexing to multiple single-antenna receivers each of which implements information decoding (ID) or energy harvesting (EH). Since EH receivers in practice operate with considerably higher received power than ID receivers, we propose a receiver location based transmission scheduling, where receivers that are close to the AP are scheduled for EH while those more distant from the AP for ID. We aim to maximize the weighted sum-power transferred to all EH receivers subject to a given set of minimum signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at different ID receivers. In particular, we consider two types of ID receivers (referred to as Type I and Type II, respectively) without or with the capability of cancelling the interference from (a priori known) energy signals. For each type of ID receivers, we formulate the joint information and energy transmit beamforming design as a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). First, we obtain the globally optimal solutions for our formulated QCQPs by applying an optimization technique so-called semidefinite relaxation (SDR). It is shown via SDR that no dedicated energy beam is needed for Type I ID receivers to achieve the optimal solution; while for Type II ID receivers, employing no more than one energy beam is optimal. Next, we establish a new form of the celebrated uplink-downlink duality to develop alternative algorithms to obtain the same optimal solutions as SDR.},

abstract = {Simultaneous information and power transfer over the wireless channels potentially offers great convenience to mobile users. Yet practical receiver designs impose technical constraints on its hardware realization, as practical circuits for harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet able to decode the carried information directly. To make theoretical progress, we propose a general receiver operation, namely, dynamic power splitting (DPS), which splits the received signal with adjustable power ratio for energy harvesting and information decoding, separately. Three special cases of DPS, namely, time switching (TS), static power splitting (SPS) and on-off power splitting (OPS) are investigated. The TS and SPS schemes can be treated as special cases of OPS. Moreover, we propose two types of practical receiver architectures, namely, separated versus integrated information and energy receivers. The integrated receiver integrates the front-end components of the separated receiver, thus achieving a smaller form factor. The rate-energy tradeoff for the two architectures are characterized by a so-called rate-energy (R-E) region. The optimal transmission strategy is derived to achieve different rate-energy tradeoffs. With receiver circuit power consumption taken into account, it is shown that the OPS scheme is optimal for both receivers. For the ideal case when the receiver circuit does not consume power, the SPS scheme is optimal for both receivers. In addition, we study the performance for the two types of receivers under a realistic system setup that employs practical modulation. Our results provide useful insights to the optimal practical receiver design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT).},

abstract = {Far-field Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) has attracted significant attention in recent years. Despite the rapid progress, the emphasis of the research community in the last decade has remained largely concentrated on improving the design of energy harvester (so-called rectenna) and has left aside the effect of transmitter design. In this paper, we study the design of transmit waveform so as to enhance the DC power at the output of the rectenna. We derive a tractable model of the non-linearity of the rectenna and compare with a linear model conventionally used in the literature. We then use those models to design novel multisine waveforms that are adaptive to the channel state information (CSI). Interestingly, while the linear model favours narrowband transmission with all the power allocated to a single frequency, the non-linear model favours a power allocation over multiple frequencies. Through realistic simulations, waveforms designed based on the non-linear model are shown to provide significant gains (in terms of harvested DC power) over those designed based on the linear model and over non-adaptive waveforms. We also compute analytically the theoretical scaling laws of the harvested energy for various waveforms as a function of the number of sinewaves and transmit antennas. Those scaling laws highlight the benefits of CSI knowledge at the transmitter in WPT and of a WPT design based on a non-linear rectenna model over a linear model. Results also motivate the study of a promising architecture relying on large-scale multisine multi-antenna waveforms for WPT. As a final note, results stress the importance of modeling and accounting for the non-linearity of the rectenna in any system design involving wireless power.},

In practice, WPT is implementable by various technologies such as inductive coupling, magnetic resonate coupling, and electromagnetic (EM) radiation, for short-/mid-/long-range applications, respectively. In this paper, we consider the EM or radio signal enabled WPT in particular. Since radio signals can carry energy as well as information at the same time, a unified study on simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is pursued. Specifically, this paper studies a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless broadcast system consisting of three nodes, where one receiver harvests energy and another receiver decodes information separately from the signals sent by a common transmitter, and all the transmitter and receivers may be equipped with multiple antennas. Two scenarios are examined, in which the information receiver and energy receiver are separated and see different MIMO channels from the transmitter, or co-located and see the identical MIMO channel from the transmitter. For the case of separated receivers, we derive the optimal transmission strategy to achieve different tradeoffs for maximal information rate versus energy transfer, which are characterized by the boundary of a so-called rate-energy (R-E) region. For the case of co-located receivers, we show an outer bound for the achievable R-E region due to the potential limitation that practical energy harvesting receivers are not yet able to decode information directly. Under this constraint, we investigate two practical designs for the co-located receiver case, namely time switching and power splitting, and characterize their achievable R-E regions in comparison to the outer bound.},

abstract = {In this letter, we propose a new architecture for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) which utilizes multi-sine waveforms for energy transfer and their distinct peak-to-average-power-ratios (PAPR) for information transmission. The new form of SWIPT proposed is based on an innovative idea of conveying information using the different levels of PAPR which can be measured at the output of the rectifier for energy harvesting, enabling a low-energy combined receiver. The latter is very crucial for batteryless operation of low-energy wireless devices relying much on the harvested energy. We demonstrate how the proposed idea works in terms of the information decoding via distinct PAPR, as well as the rate-energy tradeoff for a varying number of multiple tones.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1963-2012 IEEE. To enable pervasive exploitation of wireless sensor networks, semipassive wake-up radios (WuRs) are proposed to minimize the active time of the energy-hungry main communication radio. The most challenging feature is to enhance their sensitivity, the weakest activation signal the receiver is able to sense, which is limited by the minimum turn-on voltage of the diode-based detector. In order to operate the detector at even lower power levels, a strategy to optimize the modulated WuR excitations is presented, exploiting high-peak intermittent continuous waves while preserving the required average power per bit. The design and implementation of an ultralow-power detector, fed by a dual-band antenna and loaded by the WuR backend is presented: 2.45-GHz and 868-MHz operations of the same WuR are demonstrated, with added flexibility and interoperability among different communication bands. We show that a correct WuR activation is possible with an average power per bit as low as -63 dBm at 2.45 GHz and -65 dBm at 868 MHz. This is experimentally verified by a lab-level setup and confirmed by a system implementation based on off-the-shelf components only.},

It summarizes the operating principles of a range of wireless power research into 1) the maximum power transfer and 2) the maximum energy efficiency principles. The differences and the implications of these two approaches are explained in terms of their energy efficiency and transmission distance capabilities. The differences between the system energy efficiency and the transmission efficiency are also highlighted. The review covers the two-coil systems, the four-coil systems, the systems with relay resonators and the wireless domino-resonator systems. Related issues including human exposure issues and reduction of winding resistance are also addressed. The review suggests that the use of the maximum energy efficiency principle in the two-coil systems is suitable for short-range rather than mid-range applications, the use of the maximum power transfer principle in the four-coil systems is good for maximizing the transmission distance, but is under a restricted system energy efficiency ({\textless};50{\%}); the use of the maximum energy efficiency principle in relay or domino systems may offer a good compromise for good system energy efficiency and transmission distance on the condition that relay resonators can be placed between the power source and the load.},

abstract = {The capacity of a complex and discrete time memoryless Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel under three constraints, namely, input average power, input amplitude and delivered power at the output is studied. The delivered power constraint is modelled as a linear combination of even-moment statistics of the channel input being larger than a threshold. It is shown that the capacity of an AWGN channel under transmit average power and receiver delivered power constraints is the same as the capacity of an AWGN channel under an average power constraint, however, depending on the two constraints, it can be either achieved (via Circular Symmetric Complex Gaussian (CSCG) input) or arbitrarily approached (via time sharing between inputs with high amount of information, e.g. CSCG, and inputs with high amount of power, exhibiting a low probability of high amplitude signals). As an application, a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) problem is studied, where an experimentally-validated nonlinear model of the harvester is used. It is shown that the delivered power depends on higher order statistics of the channel input. Two inner bounds, one based on complex Gaussian inputs and the other based on convexifying the optimization probability space, are obtained for the Rate-Power (RP) region. For Gaussian inputs, the optimal inputs are zero mean and a tradeoff between information and power is recognized by considering asymmetric power allocations between Inphase and Quadrature subchannels. Through numerical algorithms, it is observed that the numerically obtained input (NOI) distributions attain larger RP region compared to Gaussian input counterparts. The benefits of the newly developed and optimized input distributions are also confirmed and validated through realistic circuit simulations.},

A promising energy harvesting technology is wireless power transfer where terminals harvest energy from electromagnetic radiation. Thereby, the energy may be harvested opportunistically from ambient electromagnetic sources or from sources that intentionally transmit electromagnetic energy for energy harvesting purposes. A particularly interesting and challenging scenario arises when sources perform simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), as strong signals not only increase power transfer but also interference. This paper provides an overview of SWIPT systems with a particular focus on the hardware realization of rectenna circuits and practical techniques that achieve SWIPT in the domains of time, power, antennas, and space.

abstract = {Radio waves carry both energy and information simultaneously. Nevertheless, Radio-Frequency (RF) transmission of these quantities have traditionally been treated separately. Currently, we are experiencing a paradigm shift in wireless network design, namely unifying wireless transmission of information and power so as to make the best use of the RF spectrum and radiations as well as the network infrastructure for the dual purpose of communicating and energizing. In this paper, we review and discuss recent progress on laying the foundations of the envisioned dual purpose networks by establishing a signal theory and design for Wireless Information and Power Transmission (WIPT) and identifying the fundamental tradeoff between conveying information and power wirelessly. We start with an overview of WIPT challenges and technologies, namely Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT),Wirelessly Powered Communication Network (WPCN), and Wirelessly Powered Backscatter Communication (WPBC). We then characterize energy harvesters and show how WIPT signal and system designs crucially revolve around the underlying energy harvester model. To that end, we highlight three different energy harvester models, namely one linear model and two nonlinear models, and show how WIPT designs differ for each of them in single-user and multi-user deployments. Topics discussed include rate-energy region characterization, transmitter and receiver architecture, waveform design, modulation, beamforming and input distribution optimizations, resource allocation, and RF spectrum use. We discuss and check the validity of the different energy harvester models and the resulting signal theory and design based on circuit simulations, prototyping and experimentation. We also point out numerous directions that are promising for future research.},

abstract = {Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is expected to be a technology reshaping the landscape of low-power applications such as the Internet of Things, Radio Frequency identification (RFID) networks, etc. Although there has been some progress towards multi-antenna multi-sine WPT design, the large-scale design of WPT, reminiscent of massive MIMO in communications, remains an open challenge. In this paper, we derive efficient multiuser algorithms based on a generalizable optimization framework, in order to design transmit sinewaves that maximize the weighted-sum/minimum rectenna output DC voltage. The study highlights the significant effect of the nonlinearity introduced by the rectification process on the design of waveforms in multiuser systems. Interestingly, in the single-user case, the optimal spatial domain beamforming, obtained prior to the frequency domain power allocation optimization, turns out to be Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT). In contrast, in the general weighted sum criterion maximization problem, the spatial domain beamforming optimization and the frequency domain power allocation optimization are coupled. Assuming channel hardening, low-complexity algorithms are proposed based on asymptotic analysis, to maximize the two criteria. The structure of the asymptotically optimal spatial domain precoder can be found prior to the optimization. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated. Numerical results confirm the inefficiency of the linear model-based design for the single and multi-user scenarios. It is also shown that as nonlinear model-based designs, the proposed algorithms can benefit from an increasing number of sinewaves.},

abstract = {In this letter, we propose a practical non-linear energy harvesting model and design a resource allocation algorithm for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems. The algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem for the maximization of the total harvested power at energy harvesting receivers subject to minimum required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) at multiple information receivers. We transform the considered non-convex objective function from sum-of-ratios form into an equivalent objective function in subtractive form, which enables the derivation of an efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm. In each iteration, a rank-constrained semidefinite program (SDP) is solved optimally by SDP relaxation. Numerical results unveil a substantial performance gain that can be achieved if the resource allocation design is based on the proposed non-linear energy harvesting model instead of the traditional linear model.},

abstract = {The design of Wireless Information and Power Transfer (WIPT) has so far relied on an oversimplified and inaccurate linear model of the energy harvester. In this paper, we depart from this linear model and design WIPT considering the rectifier nonlinearity. We develop a tractable model of the rectifier nonlinearity that is flexible enough to cope with general multicarrier modulated input waveforms. Leveraging that model, we motivate and introduce a novel WIPT architecture relying on the superposition of multi-carrier unmodulated and modulated waveforms at the transmitter. The superposed WIPT waveforms are optimized as a function of the channel state information so as to characterize the rate-energy region of the whole system. Analysis and numerical results illustrate the performance of the derived waveforms and WIPT architecture and highlight that nonlinearity radically changes the design of WIPT. We make key and refreshing observations. First, analysis (confirmed by circuit simulations) shows that modulated and unmodulated waveforms are not equally suitable for wireless power delivery, namely modulation being beneficial in single-carrier transmissions but detrimental in multi-carrier transmissions. Second, a multicarrier unmodulated waveform (superposed to a multi-carrier modulated waveform) is useful to enlarge the rate-energy region of WIPT. Third, a combination of power splitting and time sharing is in general the best strategy. Fourth, a non-zero mean Gaussian input distribution outperforms the conventional capacity-achieving zero-mean Gaussian input distribution in multi-carrier transmissions. Fifth, the rectifier nonlinearity is beneficial to system performance and is essential to efficient WIPT design.},

abstract = {In this paper, a design method for the co-design and integration of a CMOS rectifier and small loop antenna is described. In order to improve the sensitivity, the antenna-rectifier interface is analyzed as it plays a crucial role in the co-design optimization. Subsequently, a 5-stage cross-connected differential rectifier with a 7-bit binary-weighted capacitor bank is designed and fabricated in standard 90 nmCMOS technology. The rectifier is brought at resonance with a high-Q loop antenna by means of a control loop that compensates for any variation at the an- tenna-rectifier interface and passively boosts the antenna voltage to enhance the sensitivity. A complementary MOS diode is pro- posed to improve the harvester's ability to store and hold energy over a long period of time during which there is insufficient power for rectification. The chip is ESD protected and integrated on a compact loop antenna. Measurements in an anechoic chamber at 868 MHz demonstrate a –27 dBm sensitivity for 1 V output across a capacitive load and 27meter range for a 1.78WRF source in an office corridor.

abstract = {In this paper, we study information-theoretic limits for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems employing a practical nonlinear radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting (EH) receiver. In particular, we consider a three-node system with one transmitter that broadcasts a common signal to separated information decoding (ID) and EH receivers. Owing to the nonlinearity of the EH receiver circuit, the efficiency of wireless power transfer depends significantly on the waveform of the transmitted signal. In this paper, we aim to answer the following fundamental question: What is the optimal input distribution of the transmit waveform that maximizes the rate of the ID receiver for a given required harvested power at the EH receiver? In particular, we study the capacity of a SWIPT system impaired by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) under average-power (AP) and peak-power (PP) constraints at the transmitter and an EH constraint at the EH receiver. Using Hermite polynomial bases, we prove that the optimal capacity-achieving input distribution that maximizes the rate-energy region is unique and discrete with a finite number of mass points. Furthermore, we show that the optimal input distribution for the same problem without PP constraint is discrete whenever the EH constraint is active and continuous zero-mean Gaussian, otherwise. Our numerical results show that the rate-energy region is enlarged for a larger PP constraint and that the rate loss of the considered SWIPT system compared to the AWGN channel without EH receiver is reduced by increasing the AP budget.},

In the field of wireless telecommunications, multisines are often used to provide realistic test signals that have statistics similar to various types of digitally modulated signals. It is concluded that the multisine approach is well suited for evaluating a nonlinear system excited by real communication signals. Multisine signals enable to gather important information about the in-band distortion and to excite long-term memory effects by generating baseband components. They are periodic and straightforward to characterize, making them ideal for identifying both magnitude and phase distortion during test and verification.

abstract = {This paper considers orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. We study the resource allocation algorithm design for maximization of the energy efficiency of data transmission (bits/Joule delivered to the receivers). In particular, we focus on power splitting hybrid receivers which are able to split the received signals into two power streams for concurrent information decoding and energy harvesting. Two scenarios are investigated considering different power splitting abilities of the receivers. In the first scenario, we assume receivers which can split the received power into a continuous set of power streams with arbitrary power splitting ratios. In the second scenario, we examine receivers which can split the received power only into a discrete set of power streams with fixed power splitting ratios. For both scenarios, we formulate the corresponding algorithm design as a non-convex optimization problem which takes into account the circuit power consumption, the minimum data rate requirements of delay constrained services, the minimum required system data rate, and the minimum amount of power that has to be delivered to the receivers. By exploiting fractional programming and dual decomposition, suboptimal iterative resource allocation algorithms are developed to solve the non-convex problems. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed iterative resource allocation algorithms approach the optimal solution within a small number of iterations and unveil the trade-off between energy efficiency, system capacity, and wireless power transfer: (1) wireless power transfer enhances the system energy efficiency by harvesting energy in the radio frequency, especially in the interference limited regime; (2) the presence of multiple receivers is beneficial for the system capacity, but not necessarily for the system energy efficiency.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2000-2012 IEEE. Traditionally, wireless power is delivered through single-carrier, continuous-wave (CW) signals. Most research efforts to enhance the efficiency of wireless power transfer systems have been confined to the circuit-level design. However, in recent years, attention has been paid to the waveform design for wireless power transmission. It has been found that signals featuring a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) can provide efficiency improvement when compared with CW signals. A number of approaches have been proposed, such as multisines/multicarrier orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) signals, chaotic signals, harmonicsignals, ultrawideband (UWB) signals, intermittent CW (ICW) signals, or white-noise signals. This article reviews these techniques with a focus on multisines/multicarrier signals, harmonic signals, and chaotic signals. A theoretical explanation for efficiency improvement is provided and accompanied by experimental results. Circuit design considerations are presented for the receiver side, and efficient transmission architectures are also described with an emphasis on spatial power combining.},

abstract = {Energy harvesting is a promising solution to prolong the operation of energy-constrained wireless networks. In particular, scavenging energy from ambient radio signals, namely wireless energy harvesting (WEH), has recently drawn significant attention. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point wireless link over the narrowband flat-fading channel subject to time-varying co-channel interference. It is assumed that the receiver has no fixed power supplies and thus needs to replenish energy opportunistically via WEH from the unintended interference and/or the intended signal sent by the transmitter. We further assume a single-antenna receiver that can only decode information or harvest energy at any time due to the practical circuit limitation. Therefore, it is important to investigate when the receiver should switch between the two modes of information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH), based on the instantaneous channel and interference condition. In this paper, we derive the optimal mode switching rule at the receiver to achieve various trade-offs between wireless information transfer and energy harvesting. Specifically, we determine the minimum transmission outage probability for delay-limited information transfer and the maximum ergodic capacity for no-delay-limited information transfer versus the maximum average energy harvested at the receiver, which are characterized by the boundary of so-called "outage-energy" region and "rate-energy" region, respectively. Moreover, for the case when the channel state information (CSI) is known at the transmitter, we investigate the joint optimization of transmit power control, information and energy transfer scheduling, and the receiver's mode switching. Our results provide useful guidelines for the efficient design of emerging wireless communication systems powered by opportunistic WEH.},

Recently developed solution methods can solve even large-scale GPs extremely efficiently and reliably; at the same time a number of practical problems, particularly in circuit de- sign, have been found to be equivalent to (or well approximated by) GPs. Putting these two together, we get effective solutions for the practical problems. The basic approach in GP modeling is to attempt to express a practical problem, such as an en- gineering analysis or design problem, in GP format. In the best case, this formulation is exact; when this is not possible, we settle for an approximate formulation.

abstract = {Energy harvesting is a promising solution to prolong the operation time of energy-constrained wireless networks. In particular, scavenging energy from ambient radio signals, namely wireless energy harvesting (WEH), has recently drawn significant attention. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point wireless link over the flat-fading channel, where the receiver has no fixed power supplies and thus needs to replenish energy via WEH from the signals sent by the transmitter. We first consider a SISO (single-input single-output) system where the single-antenna receiver cannot decode information and harvest energy independently from the same signal received. Under this practical constraint, we propose a dynamic power splitting (DPS) scheme, where the received signal is split into two streams with adjustable power levels for information decoding and energy harvesting separately based on the instantaneous channel condition that is assumed to be known at the receiver. We derive the optimal power splitting rule at the receiver to achieve various trade-offs between the maximum ergodic capacity for information transfer and the maximum average harvested energy for power transfer, which are characterized by the boundary of a so-called "rate-energy (R-E)" region. Moreover, for the case when the channel state information is also known at the transmitter, we investigate the joint optimization of transmitter power control and receiver power splitting. The achievable R-E region by the proposed DPS scheme is also compared against that by the existing time switching scheme as well as a performance upper bound by ignoring the practical receiver constraint. Finally, we extend the result for optimal DPS to the SIMO (single-input multiple-output) system where the receiver is equipped with multiple antennas. In particular, we investigate a low-complexity power splitting scheme, namely antenna switching, which achieves the near-optimal rate-energy trade-offs as compared to the optimal DPS.

@article{Huang2018,
abstract = {Waveform design is a key technique to jointly exploit a beamforming gain, the channel frequency-selectivity and the rectifier nonlinearity, so as to enhance the end-to-end power transfer efficiency of Wireless Power Transfer (WPT). Those waveforms have been designed assuming perfect channel state information at the transmitter. This paper proposes two waveform strategies relying on limited feedback for multi-antenna multi-sine WPT over frequency-selective channels. In the waveform selection strategy, the Energy Transmitter (ET) transmits over multiple timeslots with every time a different waveform precoder within a codebook, and the Energy Receiver (ER) reports the index of the precoder in the codebook that leads to the largest harvested energy. In the waveform refinement strategy, the ET sequentially transmits two waveforms in each stage, and the ER reports one feedback bit indicating an increase/decrease in the harvested energy during this stage. Based on multiple one-bit feedback, the ET successively refines waveform precoders in a tree-structured codebook over multiple stages. By employing the framework of the generalized Lloyd's algorithm, novel algorithms are proposed for both strategies to optimize the codebooks in both space and frequency domains. The proposed limited feedback-based waveform strategies are shown to outperform a set of baselines, achieving higher harvested energy.},

abstract = {Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is a promising solution to increase the lifetime of wireless nodes and hence alleviate the energy bottleneck of energy constrained wireless networks. As an alternative to conventional energy harvesting techniques, SWIPT relies on the use of radio frequency signals, and is expected to bring some fundamental changes to the design of wireless communication networks. This article focuses on the application of advanced smart antenna technologies, including multiple-input multiple-output and relaying techniques, to SWIPT. These smart antenna technologies have the potential to significantly improve the energy efficiency and also the spectral efficiency of SWIPT. Different network topologies with single and multiple users are investigated, along with some promising solutions to achieve a favorable trade-off between system performance and complexity. A detailed discussion of future research challenges for the design of SWIPT systems is also provided.},

abstract = {The idea of wireless power transfer (WPT) has been around since the inception of electricity. In the late 19th century, Nikola Tesla described the freedom to transfer energy between two points without the need for a physical connection to a power source as an ?all-surpassing importance to man? [1]. A truly wireless device, capable of being remotely powered, not only allows the obvious freedom of movement but also enables devices to be more compact by removing the necessity of a large battery. Applications could leverage this reduction in size and weight to increase the feasibility of concepts such as paper-thin, flexible displays [2], contact-lens-based augmented reality [3], and smart dust [4], among traditional point-to-point power transfer applications. While several methods of wireless power have been introduced since Tesla?s work, including near-field magnetic resonance and inductive coupling, laser-based optical power transmission, and far-field RF/microwave energy transmission, only RF/microwave and laser-based systems are truly long-range methods. While optical power transmission certainly has merit, its mechanisms are outside of the scope of this article and will not be discussed.},
